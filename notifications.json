    "message": "Added fallback information for Samehadaku API. Sometimes the API may return errors depending on request limits or server response. Recommended solutions:\n- Run the request on a VPS or other hosting service for better uptime.\n- Test the API response directly in the browser before implementation.\n- Implement retry/fallback handling when the main endpoint fails.\n- Note: In some cases, integration works on websites even if local testing fails."
